# Agent Deposit Guide: Source Wallet Tracking

## Overview

This guide explains how to make deposits using the updated Clazino Agent Dashboard with the new source wallet tracking feature.

## Why We Ask for Your Source Wallet

We need to know which wallet you're sending USDT from to:
- ✅ Verify the deposit belongs to you
- ✅ Resolve any missing or delayed deposits quickly
- ✅ Prevent unauthorized wallet usage
- ✅ Maintain accurate records

## How to Deposit USDT

### Step 1: Open the Deposit Modal

1. Go to the **Wallet** page
2. Click the **"Deposit USDT"** button

You'll see the deposit form with all necessary information.

### Step 2: Provide Your Sending Wallet Address

You have two options:

#### **Option A: Manual Entry (Simple)**

1. In the **"Your sending wallet"** section, paste your wallet address
2. Clear warning will appear: 
   > "Send USDT only from this wallet. Deposits from other wallets may be delayed or rejected."
3. Your address is now set

#### **Option B: Connect Coinductor Wallet (Recommended)**

1. Click **"Connect Coinductor Wallet"** button
2. Confirm the connection
3. Your wallet address auto-fills and is marked as **"Verified"**
4. Done! No manual entry needed

### Step 3: Get the Deposit Address

1. You'll see the **Casino Deposit Address**
2. This is where you need to send your USDT
3. Click the **copy button** or scan the **QR code**

### Step 4: Send Your USDT

1. Using your wallet app (wallet must be the one you registered):
   - Go to "Send" in your wallet
   - Paste the casino deposit address
   - Amount: Type how much USDT you want to deposit
   - Network: Make sure it's **TRC-20 (TRON network)**
   - Send!

### Step 5: Confirm in Dashboard

1. Back in the dashboard, after sending:
2. Click **"I have sent USDT"**
3. You'll see a confirmation message
4. Check the "Pending deposits" section - your deposit will appear here

### Step 6: Wait for Confirmation

- Deposits typically confirm after **TRC-20 network confirmations** (usually 5-30 minutes)
- Once confirmed, funds move to "Confirmed deposits"
- Balance updates automatically

## Important Reminders ⚠️

### Must Send From Your Registered Wallet

- **Do NOT** send from a different wallet
- **Do NOT** send from exchanges (unless that's your registered wallet)
- **Do NOT** ask someone else to send on your behalf

**Why?** Deposits from other wallets may be:
- ⏸️ Delayed
- ❌ Rejected
- 🔍 Flagged for manual review

### USDT Must Be on TRC-20

- Only USDT on **TRC-20 (TRON)** network
- Not USDT on Ethereum, Polygon, or other networks
- Other tokens sent to the casino address will be **lost forever**

## Troubleshooting

### Deposit Doesn't Appear in Pending

1. **Check network**: Did you send on TRC-20?
2. **Check sender**: Did you send from your registered wallet?
3. **Check address**: Is the casino address correct?
4. **Check amount**: Did you send at least the minimum?

**If still not appearing**: Contact support with:
- Your transaction hash (from your wallet)
- Amount sent
- Your registered wallet address
- Time you sent it

### Deposit Takes Too Long to Confirm

1. TRC-20 confirmations can take 5-30 minutes
2. Network congestion may cause delays
3. If waiting longer than 1 hour, contact support with your transaction hash

### Wrong Wallet Used

**If you sent from the wrong wallet:**
1. Contact support immediately
2. Provide your transaction hash
3. Provide the wallet you sent from
4. Your funds may need manual review to process

## Viewing Deposit History

1. Go to **Wallet** page
2. Scroll to **"Wallet Ledger"**
3. Filter by **"Agent Deposit"** type
4. Click any deposit to see:
   - Amount
   - Date/time
   - Reference ID
   - **Your source wallet address** ← New!

This helps you track which wallet you've used for each deposit.

## Quick Tips

✅ **Before you deposit:**
- Confirm you're sending from the right wallet
- Double-check the casino address (copy, don't type)
